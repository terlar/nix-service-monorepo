* Guidelines
** Derivations
- Keep small and isolated
** Components
- A small isolated "deployable" unit (a datastore, a delivery mechanism, an API GW, a set
  of lambda functions)
- Self-contained
- Loose connection to other dependencies (components)
- 12 factor app
** Services
- Built up from several different components.

* DSL
Nix module system to easier extend parts
